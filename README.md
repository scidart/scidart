**SciDart** is a experimental cross-platform scientific library for Dart.

## Goals

The main goal of **SciDart** is run where Dart can run, in other words, run on Flutter, Dart CLI, Dart web, etc.

## Motivation

Some time ago I tried make a guitar tuner (frequency estimator) with Flutter, and I faced with the problem: Dart didn't 
have a unified scientific library. 
So, I tried implement something to help me and the community with this problem.

## How to contribute

I recommend check the __Projects__ section and choose a task or choose and solve a problem with **SciDart** and 
implement the missing parts and read the file CONTRIBUTING.md.

The reference values for all functions came from with SciPy. The contributions need use SciPy as reference too.
